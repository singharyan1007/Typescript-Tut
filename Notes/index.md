*Why are we using typescript in first place ?*
>**Simple answer is type safety**

</br>

For Example `undefined + 2 = NaN` in Javascript, which is one of the quirky behaviours of Javascript. 
<h3>What typescript does ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Static checking - just like in java/golang, it analyses the code without even compiling it, gives you hint about the error.  </li>
</ul>


Typescript is still just a development tool. The code still runs on JS. The typescript code is transpiled/compiled to JS in the end.
