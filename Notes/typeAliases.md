### Type aliases

A type alias is exactly that - a name for any type. The syntax for a type alias is:
```bash
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};
 
// Exactly the same as the earlier example
function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
 
printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
```

You can actually use a type alias to give a name to any type at all, not just an object type.
